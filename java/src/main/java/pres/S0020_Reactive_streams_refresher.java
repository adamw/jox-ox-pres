    Reactive streams are useful! What are they?
    * "govern the exchange of stream data across an asynchronous boundary"
    * within bounded memory (receiver is not overwhelmed by the sender)

    When to use RS?
    * process streaming data, that cannot be entirely read into memory
    * manage concurrency
    * interface with I/O operations in an efficient way
    * safely handle errors
